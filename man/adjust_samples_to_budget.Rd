\usage{
adjust_samples_to_budget(
  data,
  group = NULL,
  budget,
  sample_to_adjust,
  adjusted_sample = "justert_ant_prover",
  adjust_by
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{\[data.frame\] . Data including a column with the sample number
that should be adjusted.}

\item{group}{\[character\]. Vector with group variables.}

\item{budget}{The total budgeted sample number or a column in data with the
budget number of samples (per group).}

\item{sample_to_adjust}{\[character\]. The name of the column with the sample
number per unit that should be adjusted.}

\item{adjusted_sample}{\[character\]. The name of the new column with the
adjusted sample number per unit.}

\item{adjust_by}{\[number\]. The maximum number of samples that a sample can
be adjust by. Defaults to 1.}
}
\value{
A data frame with a new column with an adjusted sample number.
}
\description{
Adds a new column with an adjusted sample number per selected
     unit. The total sample size is adjusted to be in accord with the total
     budgeted sample number.
}
\details{
The sample number per unit should first have been estimated, for
    example can the sample number per abattoir be the total number of
    samples distributed on the abattoirs in accord with the slaughter volume
    at each abattoir. Often will rounding errors lead to a difference between
    the total budgeted sample number and the total estimated sample number.
    Therefore, the estimated sample number need to be adjusted.

    The estimated sample number is first adjusted for the unit with the
    largest sample number. Thereafter, for the unit with the next largest
    sample number and so on.

    The sample number will often be estimated so that it is a multiplicand
    multiplied by of a given number (multiplier). For example, if equal
    number of samples should be taken every month the multiplier can be 12,
    if the samples are pooled five and five, the multiplier can be 5. If the
    argument adjust_by is given the multiplier, the sample number will be
    adjusted by the multiplier unless the difference that should be adjusted
    is less than the multiplier. In that case, the sample number will be
    adjusted by a number less than the adjust_by.
